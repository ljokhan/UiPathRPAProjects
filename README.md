# UiPathRPAProjects
This Github repository stores my UiPath projects:

    (1) Financial Project - Credit Card Fraud Detection

    (2) Financial Project - Vanguard ETF analysis

UiPath Studio's version control is connected to my Github account.

When changes are completed, I commit and push the changes to my DEV branch.

After creating a new pull request, I approve it and merge it with the MAIN branch.
